What I Did Today:
- Worked on making the map that Ray designed more dynamic
- Implemented the same design pattern as the H&S site using a list and api request to populate a js object
- This approach allows HR to manage the data for these sites without IT assistance
- One issue can be that the request of the data can be costly in terms on time efficiency 

Ideas For Future Developments:
- I'd like to try and cache the data of the populated objects that get the data form the sp lists because the process is costly in terms of time resources
- Caching is also a useful skill to learn since it optimize time costs by storing data that will be used again
- The faster load times will make the site feel more professional which is more immersful for the user and builds greater trust in the Langan sites as a whole
